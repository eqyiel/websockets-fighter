* What is this
  Individual game project for my topic COMP3752.  It's a two player fighting
  style game using
  [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets][WebSockets]] for
  communication.  Tested using Firefox 38.0.5 and Chromium 43.0.2357.125.  The
  WebSockets API is experimental, so if it doesn't work in your browser you
  might have better luck with one of those.  There's a demo server running
  [http://rkm.id.au:8080][here].  If there are no other players, try opening a
  second instance in a new tab or window.

* How to play
  You're the red cat, the objective is to push the blue cat off the platform.
  Movement keys are =←= and =→=, attack keys are =asdf=.

* Installation
** Client
   None.  You just need to navigate to the page in Firefox or Chrom{e,ium}.

** Server
   You need Python 3.
   #+begin_src shell :tangle yes
   $ git clone https://github.com/eqyiel/websockets-fighter
   $ cd websockets-fighter
   $ pyvenv .
   $ source bin/activate
   $ pip install -r dependencies.txt
   $ ./main.py
   #+end_src

* Caveats
  - Doesn't work on mobile devices yet, but it might in the future.  It should
    be just a matter of listening for touch events.

* Thanks
